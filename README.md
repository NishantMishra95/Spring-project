# Spring-project

This project is based on shopping cart where there are two sections which are admin and user section. Admin section requires authentication which is achieved using Spring security.
Admin can add any page, category of products and product itself. User can only access the user part where he/she can buy the products. Technology used in the project is Spring 
boot and Data JPA and the presentation and view is built using Thymeleaf template. Checkout link is there which directs to paypal for payment.
